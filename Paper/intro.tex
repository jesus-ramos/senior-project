\section{Introduction}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the following section we
provide background information on the use of SSD's as local cache
devices. Section~\ref{sec:related} discusses related work and current approaches
used to save energy in cloud based systems as well as different approaches to
caching. Section~\ref{sec:implementation} details the design and implementation
of the caching policies that were implemented as well as the tools used to
measure power consumption online. In Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} we present our
test setup and evaluation of these caching algorithms as well as power
consumption statistics for each. Our discussion and future work is detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} and Section~\ref{sec:future} respectively and we
conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
