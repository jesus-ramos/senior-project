\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper proposes an improvement to leverage current block level caching
mechanisms to save energy in cloud storage systems. In order to better exploit
caching mechanisms the old policy in DM-Cache was replaced with smarter cache
eviction policies, namely LRU and LFU. To take advantage of long idle periods on
the storage nodes a daemon that interacts with the cache and storage node was
created to spin down the mechanical disks on the storage node in order to save
energy. These changes led to lower power consumption of storage nodes as some
requests could now be serviced by much faster and more energy efficient solid
state disks.
