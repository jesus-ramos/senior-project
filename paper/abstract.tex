  In this paper, we explore ways to save power with Device Mapper Cache
  (DM-Cache). We devise an online power monitoring scheme using the Watts Up?
  Pro power meter to evaluate our implementation.  The current version of DM
  Cache offers high performance by keeping a portion of the working set of
  processes in a local cache, where data can be accessed faster than when it is
  stored on the storage server disk.

  Our preliminary results indicate that DM Cache uses less power in Write Back
  (WB) mode for both cache hits and cache misses. To improve on the initial
  power saving, we implement a hybrid cache management policy with Least
  Recently Used (LRU) as the replacement policy for workloads with temporal
  locality, and Least Frequently Used (LFU) for workloads with no apparent
  locality. We also implement a spin down policy to save power on the storage
  server when there is low disk activity, such as when the cache is large enough
  to hold the entire working set of running programs.
