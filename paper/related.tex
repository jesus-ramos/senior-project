Caching data on SSDs for the goal of saving power is not a new concept. Some of
the ideas presented in this paper are borrowed from previous work on using SSD's
as cache for the slower and more energy consuming hard disk drives
\cite{flash-disk-hybrid}. Although the techniques used here differ somewhat,
methods for accurately modeling power consumption in HDDs have been extensively
explored. For instance, Zedlewski, et al., have successfully developed a
modeling technique for empirically extracting parameters from hard disk drives,
taking seeks, spins, and idle power into account
\cite{hard-disk-power}. Although simulators have been created for evaluating
performance on NAND Flash-based SSDs \cite{flashsim}, to the best of our
knowledge, there is little development on accurate modeling of energy
consumption for solid state drives. One source analyzes the energy efficiency of
flash-based SSDs, but no advanced modeling technique is used
\cite{ssd-energy-efficiency}.
