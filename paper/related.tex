Caching data on SSDs for the goal of saving power is not a new concept. Some of
the ideas presented in this paper are borrowed from previous work on using SSD's
as cache for the slower and more energy consuming hard disk drives
\cite{flash-disk-hybrid}. Although the techniques used here differ somewhat,
methods for accurately modeling power consumption in HDDs have been extensively
explored. For instance Zedlewski et al.\ successfully developed a modeling
technique for empirically extracting parameters from hard disk drives, taking
seeks, spins, and idle power into account \cite{hard-disk-power}. Although
simulators have been created for evaluating performance on NAND Flash-based SSDs
\cite{flashsim}, to the best of our knowledge, there is little development on
accurate modeling of energy consumption for solid state drives. One source
analyzes the energy efficiency of flash-based SSDs, but no advanced modeling
technique is used \cite{ssd-energy-efficiency}.
