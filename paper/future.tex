\subsection{Dynamic Disk Spinning}

For the purpose of this paper a very basic algorithm was used for the spinning
up and down of disks on the storage node. This work can be expanded by using
more complicated algorithms that take into account prefetching as well as some
prediction schemes based on how data is being requested. The long term effects
of such spinning up and down of disks can also be examined and how this would
affect the life of the disks.

\subsection{Cache Management Algorithms in DM-Cache}

In this paper we implemented two common algorithms into DM-Cache, namely LRU and
LFU. This work could be extended by making the cache management policy in
DM-Cache modular and allowing for more algorithms to be implemented. With
DM-Cache now having the ability to handle caches for distinct virtual machines
this can have added benefits as you can specify different caching policies per
virtual machine which better suit the workload.
